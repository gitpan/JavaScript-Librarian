NAME
    JavaScript::Librarian - Load and use libraries of JavaScript packages

DESCRIPTION
    "JavaScript::Librarian" is a package for loading and using "libraries"
    of JavaScript packages, managing dependencies between the files, and
    generating fragments of HTML with the <script> tags to load them in the
    correct order.

STATUS
    This is an early release, and while it implements the core object and
    logic, this package does not yet come with any Library sub-classes
    capable of loading the required metadata from anything.

    This will be dealth with in a seperate package, or in a future version
    of this one. For the moment consider it something you can use to build
    your own modules. See the source code for more documentation.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should always be submitted via the CPAN bug tracker
